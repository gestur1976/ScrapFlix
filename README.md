# Movie Sheet Scraper

## Overview
The Movie Sheet Scraper is a specialized tool designed to extract detailed information from movie pages and organize it into a structured JSON file. This program is particularly useful for those looking to gather comprehensive data on films for various applications, such as database creation, content analysis, or personal collection cataloging.

### Features
- **Data Extraction**: Automatically scrapes detailed movie information from web pages.
- **JSON Format**: Converts all extracted data into a well-organized JSON file for ease of use and integration with other applications.
- **"Copywrited" Synopsis Generation**: Utilizes an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) to create unique, copyright-protected synopses for each movie.

## Compatibility
Currently, the Movie Sheet Scraper is compatible exclusively with [FilmAffinity](https://www.filmaffinity.com). This limitation is due to the specific structure and layout of FilmAffinity's website, which the scraper is tailored to navigate and extract data from. Future updates may include compatibility with other movie databases.

## Installation and Usage
Instructions for installation and usage will be provided here. This will include steps on how to set up the tool, configure it for FilmAffinity, and guidelines on how to use the features effectively.
